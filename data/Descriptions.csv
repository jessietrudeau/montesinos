Kouri explains his intent to resign discreetly, citing internal exclusion, and seeks to manage the optics to appear principled rather than opportunistic. Montesinos emphasizes the urgency of having Kouri aligned by August to influence key congressional votes, especially for electing new leadership. The two agree on a $15,000 payment for Kouri’s campaign expenses, with additional support promised through intermediaries. They also discuss recruiting more defectors and using grassroots programs in Callao to build political support. The staged defection is intended to occur after the July 28 congressional transition for strategic impact. This meeting became infamous when the video was later released publicly, triggering the downfall of the Fujimori regime."

Authorities searched multiple properties tied to Ivachine, the Aybar Cancho brothers, and others, recovering documents, passports, VHS tapes, and a police vest found in a vehicle Ivachine claimed to have bought second-hand. Ivachine was questioned about his mining interests, aviation background, and ties to Luis Aybar, whom he identified as a business partner. Surveillance footage captured Ivachine meeting with individuals linked to the Russian Embassy, including multiple vehicles with diplomatic plates. He was also observed visiting various public places with suspected embassy personnel. Though much of the evidence required further analysis, Ivachine was formally detained and taken to State Security offices. The operation highlighted concerns about international coordination in arms trafficking activities."

Authorities search the property early in the morning, questioning López’s wife, Raquel Smith, who offers limited information about her husband's activities and business background. The search reveals personal documents, travel records, foreign correspondence, and various personal effects tied to López, who had recently left the residence and remained missing at the time of the raid. Officers also search vehicles registered to the family, uncovering insurance policies, driving licenses, and miscellaneous documents. Despite extensive questioning, Raquel Smith maintains limited knowledge of her husband's business dealings, claiming he worked in international transport. The operation concludes with the collection of documents and digital devices, but no immediate evidence of contraband. Additional footage documents related surveillance activities and secondary inspections at other properties."

Over several days in early September, detainees—such as Víctor Ivachine, Luis Frank Aybar Cancho, Liliana Villarreal Landeo, José Manuel López Rodríguez, and others—are brought from police cells at DININCRI to a judicial chamber where judges formally collect their personal details (“generales de ley”) and inform them of the charges against them. Each detainee signs documents and provides fingerprints before returning to their cells. On September 25, authorities conduct a heavily coordinated transfer operation, moving male detainees to Castro Castro prison and female detainees, including Villarreal Landeo, to Chorrillos. The operation includes multiple law enforcement and intelligence vehicles, with live radio communications tracking the convoy's movement across Lima. The footage shows detainees with covered faces being escorted into high-security prison facilities. The operation exemplifies the procedural and logistical scale of prosecuting those implicated in high-level arms trafficking conspiracies."

Rhaquel Granda Zapata testifies that she was coerced into sheltering the suspects and transporting them. López Rodríguez is interrogated and claims to be a Spanish business advisor. A related search at José Alejandro Del Mar Colina’s home reveals links to Japanese entities and a FAP general, along with a hunting shotgun and business documents. A car used in the operation is found registered under a shell company, “Sistemas Estratégicos Financieros S.A.” The operation highlights the intersection of arms trafficking, foreign actors, and potential military complicity."
4,6/13/1997,General EE Francisco Moncayo,s/n,x,x,,video,,x,,,,,,x,,,,,,,,"This official propaganda video, produced by the Peruvian Ministry of Defense, integrates clips from an interview with Ecuadorian General Francisco Moncayo and nationalistic messaging related to the Cenepa War. It accuses both foreign and domestic actors of attempting to undermine Peru’s sovereignty and suggests that the Peruvian media may be complicit in advancing anti-national interests. The video criticizes the press for allegedly amplifying forged documents meant to discredit the Armed Forces. A voiceover denounces these publications and questions the loyalty of media outlets that provide a platform to such narratives. The closing message, “Fuerzas Armadas del Perú,” reinforces the military’s role as defender of the nation. The video was preserved in Montesinos’s personal audiovisual archive, known as the ""vladiteca."" It exemplifies the regime’s use of state media to promote militarized patriotism and suppress dissenting views."

Schütz expresses legal concerns regarding property disputes and judicial pressures, and Montesinos assures him of protection from SUNAT and IPSS starting in January. They plan to manipulate media narratives through staged interviews with ex-Sendero Luminoso members and portray President Fujimori as a hero in upcoming projects. Montesinos promises encrypted phones for secure communication and control over judges, journalists, and media channels, including Hildebrandt and Canal 13. They also discuss undermining political opponents and using the OEA and Castillo Petrucci’s case to justify increased state authority. This tape, uncovered after Montesinos’s arrest, became critical evidence of high-level media corruption and state-sponsored propaganda. The meeting captures the regime’s systemic use of bribes, disinformation, and institutional control."
